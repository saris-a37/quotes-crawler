# Quotes Crawler

Scripts for automatic crawling of quotes from different durations into a single JSON file

> [!WARNING]
> This project comes with no guarantee as it has no official support from the quotes sources, and therefore may breaks in case of API change.

## Currently supported sources

- [x] [GPF](https://www.gpf.or.th/thai2019/About/main.php?page=memberfund&lang=en&menu=statistic): all securities, entire duration since inception, up to 15 minutes delay ([more details](#gpf))

### GPF

The script combines JSONs from `gpf.or.th`'s API (https://www.gpf.or.th/thai2019/About/memberfund-api.php), which is the source of monthly datasets shown in [GPF's fund value page](https://www.gpf.or.th/thai2019/About/main.php?page=memberfund&lang=en&menu=statistic), into a single file [gpf_data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saris-a37/quotes-crawler/refs/heads/main/GPF/gpf_data.json). The resulting JSON is in the original format queried from the API; an excerpt is provided below with keys:
